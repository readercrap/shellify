shellify
========

This is a fork from the [shellify](http://sourceforge.net/projects/shellify/) project hosted on sourceforge. It replaces my own LNK parser as it has more features!

The main changes I have added are:

- Support for custom jump lists which require the searching for LNK structures within the *.customDestinations-ms files
- Added a UUID parser which allows the extraction of MAC addresses and timestamps from the LNK files
